    `Huang and Ehrsam founded Paradigm in June 2018 with two theses: first, that crypto would be one of the most important technical and economic shifts of the coming decades; and second, that the space lacked the kind of investor they themselves would have wanted as entrepreneurs—one that was deeply 'crypto-native'.`,
    `Graham Duncan, Founder of East Rock Capital and an advisor to Paradigm, whom Huang credits as the most helpful person to the firm in its early days, was struck by their conviction from the outset. "They were consistently planning for what could happen from a size perspective in a way that seemed almost absurd to me," Duncan said. "It blew my mind, but it was not cockiness at all. Their time horizon was just so different, and what they planned for ended up happening."`,
    `They raised their first fund in late 2018, securing $400 million from elite institutions including Harvard, Stanford, and Yale—the universities' first significant crypto investments—as well as Sequoia. The fund structure was novel: open-ended with no fixed timeline for returning capital, allowing them to hold both public crypto assets and private investments. Then they made an even bolder move: rather than calling capital gradually like most venture firms, they quickly asked for the full $400 million and began averaging into Bitcoin and Ethereum, with those positions comprising about 90% of the fund to begin with. The average purchase price for Bitcoin was around $4,000 to $5,000 a coin—a massive bet that the crypto winter, which had sent Bitcoin down over 70% in 2018, would eventually thaw.`

    `Their first three hires embodied different aspects of their vision. Charlie Noyes, whom Huang met in a Telegram chat discussing Bitcoin Cash forks, became their first employee. "From his messages, I thought he was a 40-year-old with a beard, very cynical and craggy," Huang remembers. "When he showed up to dinner, I was really surprised he was 19."`,
    `Noyes had been immersed in crypto from age 12 when he discovered Bitcoin through gaming circles. He'd already published research papers on crypto applications and won Intel's science competition twice, before dropping out of school to attend MIT, and then dropping out of there to join Paradigm. His initial adjustment to office life was rocky—he thought "opining on pitch decks over email and coming to the office once a week" was normal. When he showed up late on his first day, Huang sat him down to explain professional expectations. The patience paid off.`,
    `Today, Noyes is 25 and already one of Paradigm's general partners. Huang likens him to an artist, capable of making large intuitive leaps by condensing vast amounts of disparate information and coming out the other side with a crystal-clear investment thesis. Like when he identified MEV as a pivotal blockchain issue in 2020 and became the lead investor in Flashbots, whose infrastructure now touches nearly every transaction on Ethereum and has established critical market rules for the $450 billion ecosystem.`
