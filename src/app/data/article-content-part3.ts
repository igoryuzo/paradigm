    `Leaving home`,
    `Huang first encountered Bitcoin in 2010 while at MIT, immediately drawn to its elegant fusion of mathematics, economics, computer science, and game theory.`,
    `"I internalized it as just a really beautiful idea," Huang recalls. But in those early days, it seemed more of an intellectual curiosity than an investment opportunity. It wasn't until 2012 that he bought some Bitcoin on Mt. Gox, the dominant exchange at the time, and rode his first major bubble. "You almost need to lose money the first time," he reflects. "Then you kind of give up on it, write it off as dead. And when you see it come back and it's not dead, then you start to wonder."`,
    `Multiple sources reported that legendary investor Michael Moritz called Huang "the only regrettable loss in Sequoia's history." Leone said, "he was the first person in my career that had left Sequoia under his own volition."`,
    `At Sequoia, Huang found few colleagues who shared his growing conviction about crypto's importance. The firm was supportive of his interest—he led several crypto investments on its behalf—but he increasingly sought conversation partners outside its walls. He began attending monthly dinners in San Francisco with six to eight other crypto-curious investors, exploring ideas at the frontier of the emerging technology.`

    `It was during this period in 2017 that Fred Ehrsam, who had recently stepped down as President of Coinbase, wrote a blog post arguing that crypto was the metaverse. Huang, still at Sequoia, reached out to discuss the idea. "I know I'm not going to build a company around this," Ehrsam thought, "but it would be hilarious to pitch Sequoia on the idea for fun."`,
    `What began as an intellectual exercise evolved into a 40-email thread between the two, diving deep into crypto's possibilities. Their backgrounds were perfectly complementary: Ehrsam had co-founded and operated crypto's most important company, while Huang brought elite investing experience.`,
    `"Nothing felt quite right until I met Matt," says Ehrsam, who had explored starting a crypto-focused fund with several other potential partners. Over six months, they methodically explored working together, testing alignment on everything from investment philosophy to fund structure. They were particularly focused on ensuring true partnership—everything would be split 50/50, a principle that "drove some people nuts" but felt essential to both of them.`,
    `Leaving Sequoia was wrenching for Huang. It was the first place where he truly felt he belonged: "It felt like somewhere I could retire from, if they would have me." Multiple sources reported that legendary investor Michael Moritz called Huang "the only regrettable loss in Sequoia's history." Leone said, "he was the first person in my career that had left Sequoia under his own volition." But Huang had become convinced that crypto would be one of the most important technological trends of the coming decades. "When he told me he thought it was the opportunity of a lifetime, it was very easy. Follow your dreams, go after it," Leone said, with a tinge of regret. "I am very mad at myself because he had been talking about Bitcoin and I usually have a good sniffer. If I were really smart, I would have followed that and created an opportunity for him to do the fund within Sequoia."`
