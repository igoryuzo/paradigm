    `That commitment to ensuring crypto's success has led Paradigm to develop an unusual approach to investing. While most venture firms wait to back winners, Paradigm helps create the conditions that make winning possible. This means doing more than analyzing trends or writing checks—it's solving fundamental technical problems that expand what the entire industry can achieve.`,
    `The firm's research-driven style emerged almost by accident. When Huang hired his middle school friend and best man, Dan Robinson, it wasn't obvious how a former lawyer turned self-taught programmer would fit into an investment firm. "We wanted Dan on the team because he was the smartest person I knew," Huang says, "but he wasn't the most commercial, and we weren't sure how he'd input into the investment process." Mostly as a concession to bring him on board, they created a novel role that included time for Robinson to work on open-source projects, which they mutually termed "exploratory research."`,
    `"It turns out that particular genre is an incredibly important thing to do in crypto," Robinson explains. "Most investment research is about gathering and analyzing existing information. We're trying to invent new things." The research team's breakthroughs often come from exploring theoretical questions before companies even recognize they need answers, like bullseye liquidity.`,
    `What makes crypto somewhat unique is how mathematical mechanisms can create enormous leverage. A traditional exchange might need thousands of servers and hundreds of employees to match buyers and sellers. But when Vitalik Buterin proposed a simple equation (x*y=k) on Reddit in 2016, he created the foundation for trillion-dollar markets to run autonomously on a blockchain. The challenge was that this elegant solution, while computationally efficient, wasted massive amounts of capital by spreading liquidity across all possible prices.`,
    `Robinson knew Hayden Adams, who had built Buterin's concept into Uniswap, from the early Ethereum research community. Within weeks of joining Paradigm, he wrote a memo on Uniswap, which led to a seed investment, and began actively working on improvements. His contributions to Uniswap v2 enabled trading between any Ethereum-based tokens, helping the protocol expand from $2 billion in volume to over $1 trillion.`,
    `But Robinson and Adams spent most of 2019 searching for an even more fundamental breakthrough. Through mathematical exploration, the team discovered a way to efficiently concentrate liquidity within specific price ranges—allowing traders to focus capital where it was actually needed. This innovation became Uniswap v3, improving capital efficiency by up to 4,000x. A $5 million position could now provide the same trading depth as $2 billion spread across all possible prices. By October 2022, Uniswap was valued at $1.7 billion.`

    `When they go up against other firms, Paradigm can actually help you build a crypto company. They have experts on staff in protocol design, security, legal, even policy.`,
    `–Brian Armstrong, Coinbase`,
    `This pattern of research leading to breakthrough products repeats across Paradigm's portfolio. Last year, when Blur approached the firm about adding margin trading, the team faced a fundamental challenge: how do you safely lend against illiquid NFTs whose values are hard to determine? The research team spent four months developing an entirely new lending protocol called Blend. "If you can solve lending against NFTs," Robinson notes, "you can potentially solve lending against any illiquid asset." Within months of launch, Blend had created and dominated an entirely new category of lending.`,
    `Unlike traditional venture firms that separate technical resources from investment decisions, Paradigm's researchers are core to every investment. They attend every pitch meeting and help make every decision. This integration means they often identify opportunities others miss because they're already working on similar technical challenges. When algorithmic stablecoins like Terra became popular, Paradigm stayed away—years of trying to design better stablecoin mechanisms had taught the firm that these projects hadn't solved the fundamental problems.`,
    `This deep technical work creates a powerful competitive advantage in sourcing and closing deals, as well as hiring talent. "When they go up against other firms," Coinbase's Armstrong explains, "Paradigm can actually help you build a crypto company. They have experts on staff in protocol design, security, legal, even policy."`,
    `"The biggest part of our process is figuring out what's actually the most important problem," Robinson explains. This requires staying close to crypto's rapidly evolving frontier. "The internet has these very short generations," Huang notes, drawing a parallel to Sherlock Holmes's network of street urchins who provided vital intelligence from London's streets. "Even two years can make a difference in understanding crypto's culture."`,
    `This insight led to the Paradigm Fellowship, which identifies exceptional young developers while they're still in school. The program grew partly from the firm's experience with transmissions11, who the team discovered on Discord while he was still in high school. When he once dialed into a pitch meeting from a school assembly, it crystallized both the challenge and opportunity of working with crypto's next generation of innovators.`
