    `Of course, like every new technology, crypto also has a dark side. Scams and hacks are common, meme coins promote short-term thinking over building what's truly needed, token prices are volatile, projects implode, and the whole thing often looks more like a casino than the future of finance.`,
    `Yet Huang takes the long view. Like the early internet attracting brilliant researchers alongside scammers and fraudsters, crypto's open frontier enables both innovation and bad behavior. Each new wave, including speculative bubbles that can look irrational from the outside, brings in fresh talent and capital to build critical infrastructure.`,
    `Stablecoins are a perfect example. The 2017 ICO (Initial Coin Offering) bubble brought mainstream attention to crypto and minted a new generation of crypto-rich investors. Some of that capital flowed into developing stablecoins, leading to dramatic improvements in their infrastructure. On Ethereum, the cost to send USDC (a popular dollar-pegged stablecoin) has fallen from $12 in 2021 to $1 today. On Coinbase's popular Layer 2 network Base, the same transaction costs less than a cent. In turn, circulation has grown exponentially, up 400-fold since the bubble popped, and real-world use cases have emerged.`,
    `SpaceX uses stablecoins to repatriate revenue from emerging markets, converting local currencies to digital dollars that transfer instantly. Scale AI pays its global network of data labelers through stablecoin rails, eliminating cross-border friction and costs. Corporate treasury teams at companies like Ramp have found another advantage: while savings accounts pay a fraction of a percent interest, stablecoins backed by Treasury bills can capture most of the yield that banks typically keep for themselves.`,
    `The numbers confirm the narrative. Transaction volumes have grown 120% annually for five straight years. In 2024, stablecoins processed $5.6 trillion in payments, nearly half of Visa's $13.2 trillion. This momentum led Stripe to acquire Bridge, a stablecoin payments platform, in October 2024. "Stablecoins are room-temperature superconductors for financial services," wrote Stripe Co-founder Patrick Collison."Thanks to stablecoins, businesses around the world will benefit from significant speed, coverage, and cost improvements in the coming years."`

    `Matt's disposition is distinctive. He's calm, rigorous, and patient—uniquely well-suited traits to any complicated technology whose consequence is back-weighted, like crypto."`,
    `–Patrick Collison, Stripe`,
    `This adoption mirrors crypto's broader evolution: Bitcoin launched in 2009, reaching its first million users in 2011. Ethereum followed in 2015, hitting the same milestone in 2017. Then came stablecoins in 2019, DeFi in 2021, NFTs in 2022, and social applications in 2023.`,
    `Detractors often highlight the lack of impact crypto has had on day-to-day business. Huang believes stablecoins are the next killer app but also distinguishes between 'single-player' technologies like AI that provide immediate utility, and 'multiplayer' technologies like crypto that require coordinated adoption. "It's like adopting a new language or settling a new city," he explains. "It's useless if you do it alone." He points to email as an instructive parallel. Early critics called it "technologically intriguing but economically naive," much like crypto skepticism today.`,
    `When speaking with Huang, it's notable how poised he is on crypto as a whole. Patrick Collison, who added Huang to Stripe's board both for his crypto expertise and his broader business acumen, said, "Matt's disposition is distinctive. He's calm, rigorous, and patient—uniquely well-suited traits to any complicated technology whose consequence is back-weighted, like crypto."`,
    `What sets him apart is his ability to hold both sides of the investment thesis. "He can handle bear cases, which are typically much more specific than the bull case," says Collison. "And then he understands the possibilities of technology to see how small nascent things can become a very big deal in the future."`,
    `Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged as tech's new frontier, with clear and immediate applications that have captured the world's imagination. Huang and his team at Paradigm even considered expanding their focus to include AI. But they have maintained their commitment to cryptocurrency, with Huang explaining: "AI is going to be fine with or without us. Crypto is a very important technology that needs to coexist with AI, but there aren't a lot of great champions. We believe it's important for us to work on it, to make sure that it actually succeeds."`
