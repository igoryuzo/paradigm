  // Section 1: Introduction and Present Day
  [
    `"Sometimes I feel like I'm running the X-Men Academy," says Matt Huang, describing his $12 billion crypto investment firm Paradigm as a place for brilliant mutants who possess unusual powers.`,
    `Take Charlie Noyes, the firm's first hire. A 19-year-old MIT dropout who couldn't operate a calendar, he rolled into his first 10am meeting five hours late, completely unapologetic; he's now a general partner. Or Georgios Konstantopoulos, Paradigm's CTO, who transformed from a World of Warcraft addict into one of crypto's most prolific engineers. Or the developer known only by his X handle, transmissions11, whom Paradigm discovered on a Discord server while the anon was still in high school.`,
    `"They create an absurd amount of chaos sometimes and you want to pull your hair out," Huang says. "But then you see what they can do and it's like, holy crap. Nobody else in the world could do that."`,
    `On the chilly morning I visited Paradigm in San Francisco, two of Huang's team were working on a mechanism that could reshape how hundreds of billions in digital dollars move through the financial system. In a penthouse conference room, curved like the whispering gallery of a cathedral, Partner Dan Robinson tapped his Paradigm-green Nike Air Force 1s on the floor while explaining their latest breakthrough at the speed of a high-frequency trade. Research Partner Dave White, in hexagonal spectacles and a scraggly beard, was hunched over his laptop, pausing occasionally to discuss equations behind the idea he invented. Huang listened intently, his athletic frame still in a plain black Japanese sweater, his manner carrying the quiet authority of someone who's always been ahead of the curve.`,
    `"Everything he touched was good," says Doug Leone, who ran Sequoia during Huang's time there from 2014 to 2018. "He's super smart and incredibly humble. It's tough not to meet Matt and come away with the impression that he is super special."`

  // Section 2: The View from Paradigm
  [
    `Through two large arched windows high above San Francisco's Union Square, traditional finance's concrete towers loom to the east, while the startup sprawl of SoMa spreads south. It's a fitting view for a firm bridging traditional finance and bleeding-edge technology—and for Huang, whose career has been defined by spotting revolutionary potential.`,
    `In 2012, while on a week-long vacation to Beijing, he visited a startup operating from two apartment units. The Founder, Zhang Yiming, was building a personalized news app—an idea Huang thought was destined to fail. But sitting at an old Ikea table near a dusty refrigerator, watching Yiming speak through a translator, Huang noticed something that transcended language: "I remember having this very deep sense that this is an extremely competent, obsessed, aggressive person who was somehow balanced and wouldn't blow himself up. He had extreme clarity on what he was trying to build and an aggressive take-over-the-world ambition." Yiming was the most impressive person he'd ever spent time with—so impressive that Huang had to invest. That company became ByteDance, creator of TikTok, and Huang's share of it has turned into a nine-or-ten-figure sum—he doesn't keep spreadsheets, so he can't tell you exactly.`,
    `That instinct for spotting talent is central to Paradigm, which began in 2018 when Coinbase Co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, approached Huang at Sequoia Capital with a vision for a different kind of investment company. They started as equal partners, but Ehrsam has since stepped back to split his time between crypto and his new brain-computer interface startup, recognizing that Huang was, in his words, "born and bred to run Paradigm."`,
    `The son of one of the world's most accomplished financial theorists and a pioneering computer science professor, Huang grew up at the nexus of math, economics, and technology. In six years, his firm has grown from managing $400 million to over $12 billion by making early, concentrated bets on foundational crypto projects, while also building significant parts of crypto's core infrastructure. Paradigm's researchers—who double as investors—develop foundational innovations, then open-source them for the entire industry to use. It's an unusual approach for a financial firm, but Paradigm isn't a typical investment company. It's more like a research lab crossed with an engineering outfit, wrapped in the sophistication of a West Coast Wall Street.`,

  // Section 3: The Technical Work
  [
    `Back in the penthouse conference room, Robinson and White are working on 'bullseye liquidity', a breakthrough that could transform how stablecoins—digital tokens pegged to the US dollar—are traded. Stablecoins have become a crucial part of crypto's financial plumbing, yet the infrastructure for trading them remains primitive, with each pair requiring its own pool of capital. Their innovation would unite these fragmented markets in a single efficient system. Though it could give Paradigm's portfolio companies, like Uniswap and Noble, a significant edge, they plan to publish the research openly on their blog. "If someone else implemented this and it made things better for crypto overall, we'd be fine with that," Robinson says.`,
    `White pauses his work with OpenAI's o1 Pro, where he's verifying mathematical proofs, to refine a point about n-dimensional space. On the screen, Robinson projects a visualization of the math that looks like a quarter slice of Captain America's shield. Huang mostly listens—he always prefers to listen—but when he does speak, it's clear he's fully absorbed the complexity of what they're presenting.`,
    `Years ago, when they were kids, Robinson recalls, their friend group would debate endlessly until Matt spoke. "He didn't say much," Robinson says, "but we always ended up doing what he suggested." Those who know Huang best describe someone whose quiet demeanor masks extraordinary capabilities. "The insight per minute with Matt is very high, even if there are many minutes where he says nothing," observes Stripe Co-founder Patrick Collison, who added Huang to his board in 2021. His attention to detail extends to everything he touches—from the speed of Paradigm's website to the obscure Japanese streetwear he favors, to the people he hires. "He has a high bar for excellence," says Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. "There's no tolerance for mediocrity."`,
    `Yet beneath this intensity lies a disarming humility. As Leone puts it: "He has a good sense of humor but it's hidden because there's so much goodness in the man that you can't help but put your serious game on." Perhaps most telling is that these insights come from others—Huang is the type of person whose greatest achievements are whispered about rather than trumpeted, whose impact is felt more than advertised. Collison adds: "Not every great investor or great leader is a great person. In all the integrity checks of 'could this person be a godfather to your kid,' he passes emphatically with flying colors."`,
    `Paradigm isn't a typical investment company. It's more like a research lab crossed with an engineering outfit, wrapped in the sophistication of a West Coast Wall Street.`,
    `This combination of technical excellence and quiet integrity has helped establish Paradigm as one of crypto's most important institutions. In an industry that's grown from zero to $3 trillion through waves of speculation and collapse, the firm's open-source tools now power 90% of smart contract development. Its innovations help hundreds of billions in digital dollars move more efficiently. And its investments have earned the trust of the world's most sophisticated investors, including Harvard, Stanford, Sequoia and Yale.`

  // Section 4: Early Life
  [
    `Waking up`,
    `One of Matt Huang's earliest memories places him alone on the streets of Tokyo, a nine-year-old navigating the world's largest city. Each morning, he would thread his way through narrow side streets and across bustling thoroughfares on an hour-long round trip to school. This early independence shaped his worldview. "Once you have an N equals two," he said of comparing Tokyo to New York, "that changes how you relate to everything."`,
    `The family had moved to Japan in 1997 when his father, Chi-fu Huang, was tasked with establishing the Asia office of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). Before the move, the elder Huang had run LTCM's Asian trading operation from Greenwich, working 4pm to 3am to match market hours. The only son among four sisters in Taiwan, Chi-fu's parents had invested their modest savings to send him to America alone. From there, he worked his way to an economics professorship at MIT, then to Goldman Sachs where he built and led Fixed Income Derivatives Research, and finally to LTCM—a firm staffed with Nobel laureates that represented the perfect fusion of academic theory and market practice.`,
    `Huang's mother, Marina Chen, had carved her own path in academia after immigrating from Taiwan. At Caltech, she pioneered parallel computing research under legendary technologist Carver Mead, developing techniques still used in modern processors. Despite her position as one of Yale's first female computer science professors, seemingly destined for a distinguished academic career, Chen chose to leave academia to raise their three boys, channeling her intellectual intensity into their education.`,
    `Dinner at the Huang household ran like an investment committee. Each evening, the boys would hear the garage door opening and scramble to complete their father's assigned readings—carefully selected, age-adjusted articles ranging from economic principles to Scientific American. At dinner, they were expected to field questions about their allocated topics. Each brother developed different coping mechanisms to their parents' intensity. According to Matt, the eldest, his instinct was to push back.`,
    `Their Tokyo chapter ended abruptly in 1998 when LTCM's models failed during the Russian financial crisis. The collapse wiped out the Huang family's savings. Yet Chi-fu Huang emerged from the wreckage to found Platinum Grove Asset Management in 1999 with his LTCM colleague, Nobel Prize-winner Myron Scholes. The firm grew from $45 million to $6 billion in less than nine years, becoming one of the world's largest fixed-income hedge funds leading into the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern—seeing opportunity in chaos, building something new from system-wide collapse—would become familiar to his son.`

  // Section 5: Education and Transition
  [
    `The New York suburb of Scarsdale became Huang's fourth home in 11 years after Tokyo. As one of only three Asian students in his predominantly Jewish school, these constant relocations and cultural adaptations honed his ability to read social dynamics and connect with diverse personalities.`,
    `In class, Huang couldn't sit still. His restlessness led to expulsion from Chinese weekend school after repeatedly disrupting other students. "Uncontrollable," his parents would later describe him at his wedding. Yet when engaged on his own terms, he displayed an ability to focus. With his "uncool, but academically inclined" circle of friends, Huang directed amateur films, debated libertarian philosophy, and mastered games. His approach to StarCraft—competing semi-professionally on international servers—foreshadowed the attention to detail that would become his signature, extending even to his current obsession in handstands.`,
    `Everything changed when he discovered mathematics. The math club revealed a natural affinity for the subject, and while he wasn't a top competitor in national contests, it showed his parents their uncontrollable son could excel at school when appropriately challenged. Poker and chess became other outlets for his analytical mind.`,
    `The reformed student worked his way to MIT where, in 2006, he found himself among "one of the highest concentrations of strange people on the planet." He studied mathematics and, at one point, took a semester off to play online poker, working eight tables simultaneously. But the defining moment (besides meeting his future wife) came when a close friend, Albert Ni, announced he was dropping out to join a small startup called Dropbox, as its sixth employee. For someone raised to become a PhD, dropping out of a BSc seemed unthinkable. Yet Ni wasn't failing—he was one of the most capable people Huang knew, making a deliberate choice to build something new. It led him to read all of Paul Graham's essays, through which Huang discovered Silicon Valley and the temptation of ultimate rebellion: forging his own path.`
