    `"Sometimes I feel like I'm running the X-Men Academy," says Matt Huang, describing his $12 billion crypto investment firm Paradigm as a place for brilliant mutants who possess unusual powers.`,
    `Take Charlie Noyes, the firm's first hire. A 19-year-old MIT dropout who couldn't operate a calendar, he rolled into his first 10am meeting five hours late, completely unapologetic; he's now a general partner. Or Georgios Konstantopoulos, Paradigm's CTO, who transformed from a World of Warcraft addict into one of crypto's most prolific engineers. Or the developer known only by his X handle, transmissions11, whom Paradigm discovered on a Discord server while the anon was still in high school.`,
    `"They create an absurd amount of chaos sometimes and you want to pull your hair out," Huang says. "But then you see what they can do and it's like, holy crap. Nobody else in the world could do that."`,
    `On the chilly morning I visited Paradigm in San Francisco, two of Huang's team were working on a mechanism that could reshape how hundreds of billions in digital dollars move through the financial system. In a penthouse conference room, curved like the whispering gallery of a cathedral, Partner Dan Robinson tapped his Paradigm-green Nike Air Force 1s on the floor while explaining their latest breakthrough at the speed of a high-frequency trade. Research Partner Dave White, in hexagonal spectacles and a scraggly beard, was hunched over his laptop, pausing occasionally to discuss equations behind the idea he invented. Huang listened intently, his athletic frame still in a plain black Japanese sweater, his manner carrying the quiet authority of someone who's always been ahead of the curve.`,
    `"Everything he touched was good," says Doug Leone, who ran Sequoia during Huang's time there from 2014 to 2018. "He's super smart and incredibly humble. It's tough not to meet Matt and come away with the impression that he is super special."`

    `Through two large arched windows high above San Francisco's Union Square, traditional finance's concrete towers loom to the east, while the startup sprawl of SoMa spreads south. It's a fitting view for a firm bridging traditional finance and bleeding-edge technology—and for Huang, whose career has been defined by spotting revolutionary potential.`,
    `In 2012, while on a week-long vacation to Beijing, he visited a startup operating from two apartment units. The Founder, Zhang Yiming, was building a personalized news app—an idea Huang thought was destined to fail. But sitting at an old Ikea table near a dusty refrigerator, watching Yiming speak through a translator, Huang noticed something that transcended language: "I remember having this very deep sense that this is an extremely competent, obsessed, aggressive person who was somehow balanced and wouldn't blow himself up. He had extreme clarity on what he was trying to build and an aggressive take-over-the-world ambition." Yiming was the most impressive person he'd ever spent time with—so impressive that Huang had to invest. That company became ByteDance, creator of TikTok, and Huang's share of it has turned into a nine-or-ten-figure sum—he doesn't keep spreadsheets, so he can't tell you exactly.`,
    `That instinct for spotting talent is central to Paradigm, which began in 2018 when Coinbase Co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, approached Huang at Sequoia Capital with a vision for a different kind of investment company. They started as equal partners, but Ehrsam has since stepped back to split his time between crypto and his new brain-computer interface startup, recognizing that Huang was, in his words, "born and bred to run Paradigm."`,
    `The son of one of the world's most accomplished financial theorists and a pioneering computer science professor, Huang grew up at the nexus of math, economics, and technology. In six years, his firm has grown from managing $400 million to over $12 billion by making early, concentrated bets on foundational crypto projects, while also building significant parts of crypto's core infrastructure. Paradigm's researchers—who double as investors—develop foundational innovations, then open-source them for the entire industry to use. It's an unusual approach for a financial firm, but Paradigm isn't a typical investment company. It's more like a research lab crossed with an engineering outfit, wrapped in the sophistication of a West Coast Wall Street.`
