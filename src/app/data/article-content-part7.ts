    `The long view`,
    `In spite of Paradigm's early success, it's hard not to wonder why Huang, someone for whom money ceased to be a concern long ago and who seemingly had the perfect job at Sequoia, would bother with the wild world of crypto at all.`,
    `Brian Armstrong, CEO and Co-founder of Coinbase, pondered a similar question—"Who leaves a job like that at Sequoia, right?"—before answering, "He's a silent killer. Our industry needs more people like him who have high integrity and are in it for the long-term and the right reasons. He had such conviction to go off the beaten path."`,
    `For Huang, the answer is simple: "I suppose I've always had somewhat of a skepticism towards authority, and so when I see authority exerting itself, it does make me wonder: is this the way we want the world to work?"`,
    `"Everyone in the US looks at China and says, that looks dystopian," he says. "I don't think they fully realize the same thing is happening in the West."`,
    `Take the Obama administration's Operation Choke Point, in which the US Department of Justice sought to restrict certain industries' access to banking services. Operation Choke Point 1.0, which lasted from 2013–2017, targeted industries deemed 'high-risk' like payday lenders and firearms dealers. Under the Biden administration, Operation Choke Point 2.0 focused on 'debanking' crypto. Even individuals like Uniswap Founder Hayden Adams and Gemini Co-founder Tyler Winklevoss found their personal bank accounts suddenly closed without explanation.`

    `Huang sees crypto evolving in three critical stages: first as money, then as a financial system, and finally as an internet platform. Each phase builds upon and enables the next. "Money is upstream of a lot of the rest of crypto," he explains. "Buying your first Bitcoin or setting up your first wallet is often the first step towards using other crypto applications. It's like getting your AOL account and connecting to the internet for the first time."`,
    `The money stage has already produced staggering results. Bitcoin has grown from a whitepaper in 2008 to an asset worth nearly $2 trillion today, making it the most valuable startup created since it was published. Remarkably, nation-states—even the US—are beginning to adopt it.`,
    `Institutions that scoffed at the industry in 2018 (like BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink, who called Bitcoin "an index of money laundering") now embrace the technology. In 2024, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF gathered $50 billion in just 11 months—the fastest-growing ETF launch in history. Traditional portfolio models are also shifting, with Fidelity now recommending 1–3% crypto exposure. The classic 60/40 portfolio is becoming '59/39/2' as institutions carve out dedicated allocations to crypto assets.`,
    `The second stage—building an entirely new financial system—is accelerating. While traditional finance operates through layers of intermediaries, crypto can enable near-instant transactions, 24/7 markets, and novel financial instruments, all built on permissionless rails. The rise of stablecoins—blockchain-based digital currencies pegged to stable assets like US dollars—demonstrates this potential, growing from $500 million to over $200 billion in circulation since Paradigm's founding.`,
    `The third stage—as an internet platform—remains the most nascent and least legible. Unlike today's internet where platforms control user data and online assets, crypto could enable true digital ownership and direct user-to-user interactions without intermediaries. High transaction costs have held back everyday applications like social media and gaming, but Huang sees this changing as new scaling technologies drive costs down dramatically. The same infrastructure that today supports NFTs and meme coins will eventually enable more serious applications, much like YouTube evolved from cat videos to become one of the world's most important platforms.`
