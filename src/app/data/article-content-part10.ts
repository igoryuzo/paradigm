    `On the last Thursday of May 2023, reporters at crypto news firm The Block made a discovery that sparked industry-wide controversy. Using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, they noticed Paradigm had quietly removed all mentions of 'crypto' from its homepage and social media, rebranding as a 'research-driven technology investment firm'. The apparent revelation—despite the fact that the change was a month old—prompted immediate backlash. In an industry where loyalty runs deep and apostasy is harshly punished, it felt like betrayal.`,
    `"We don't want to work for you anymore," tweeted one portfolio company, referencing both the rebranding and Paradigm's investment in FTX, which "became a scar on our entire industry". The criticism stung but was characteristic of crypto's brutal honesty. Paradigm not only restored the word 'crypto' but doubled down, adding flashing neon tickers to the homepage that read: 'crypto crypto crypto'.`,
    `The reality behind the change was more mundane. Two researchers on the team had complained that potential AI collaborators weren't returning their emails after seeing 'crypto' on Paradigm's homepage. "We thought, okay, all the crypto people already know us, they never go to our homepage. They go to our blog, and every portfolio company and blog post is about crypto. So what's the big deal?" Huang explains. "In hindsight, it was clearly a mistake. People take the website as a collective statement about what you're proud of." (Patrick Collison, for one, notes that the Paradigm website is "probably the fastest you have used this year.")`,
    `The episode revealed deeper tensions, however. By November 2022, Bitcoin had plunged 75% from its peak in 2021 to below $16,000. Ethereum was down 80%. That same month, ChatGPT launched, sparking an AI boom that made crypto seem like yesterday's frontier. Major venture firms were already pivoting their attention and capital toward AI.`

    `For Paradigm, the website controversy capped a humbling period. Just 18 months earlier, the firm seemed untouchable. Its Bitcoin position had multiplied 15x. One of its earliest investments, Coinbase, had gone public at an $85 billion valuation. It had raised a $2.5 billion venture fund. Yet the euphoria of 2021 would test even crypto's most disciplined investors.`,
    `Fred Ehrsam recognized the warning signs. In March 2021, he sent a letter to portfolio companies titled 'Surviving Crypto Cycles'. After noting that prices had doubled in just two months, with Bitcoin crossing $1 trillion and "pixelated crypto art regularly selling for millions," he warned that "Senators even have lasers for eyes! Euphoria abounds." Drawing on his Coinbase experience, where a third of employees left during the 2014–2017 downturn, he outlined specific preparations: stress test systems for 10–100x usage spikes, consider fundraising while capital is available, and caution new hires about crypto's brutal cycles.`,
    `Down years are easier than up years. Signal to noise is very high and okay, prices are down, but with a long-term perspective, that doesn't bother us.`,
    `–Matt Huang, Paradigm`,
    `His warning proved prophetic but insufficient. "We made a lot of mistakes during that period," Huang reflects. "When you over-focus on a rival, you become more like the rival." He explains how watching competitor a16z raise massive funds made them question whether they needed to match that scale. Paradigm grew from 18 to 62 people. "We definitely let the quality bar slip," he admits. "I remember instances of making that compromise, feeling like if we don't do this, or hire that person, we're going to fall behind. In hindsight, those were all wrong decisions."`

    `Huang is not one for spreadsheets and doesn't remember the firm's largest peak-to-trough drawdown, but one moment is etched into his memory: FTX. Paradigm had invested $278 million in the exchange, making it one of the largest investments in the firm's history. By 2022, FTX had become crypto's public face, with founder Sam Bankman-Fried speaking at conferences, testifying before Congress, and appearing on magazine covers. That October, he gave the keynote at Paradigm's LP meeting. Weeks later, FTX collapsed amid charges of fraud and revelations that customer funds had been misappropriated.`,
    `The investment failure was total, but the betrayal cut deeper. During due diligence, Paradigm had identified the key risk: the relationship between FTX and Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research. The team asked direct questions and received false assurances. When Huang later testified in court during Bankman-Fried's criminal trial, the experience solidified an important lesson about founder alignment.`,
    `"It was pretty clear, even at the time, that he didn't share our vision for making crypto better," Huang says. "For him, it was a way to make a ton of money and then give it away." The disconnect became apparent around policy discussions, where Bankman-Fried advocated for compromises that Paradigm believed would damage crypto's core promise.`,
    `FTX wasn't Paradigm's only misstep. The firm had co-led OpenSea's $300 million Series C at a $13.3 billion valuation at the peak of the NFT craze. Since then, the NFT marketplace's trading volume has dropped 98%. BlockFi, another portfolio company, went bankrupt due to FTX exposure.`,
    `"In venture capital, there are going to be investments that don't turn out the way you hope," Huang says. "That's always an opportunity to reflect, and we've done a lot of that." He maintains that bearish periods actually provide clearer signals than bull markets. "Down years are easier than up years. Signal to noise is very high and okay, prices are down, but with a long-term perspective, that doesn't bother us."`,
    `The firm emerged from this period smaller but more focused. The investing and research team, which had grown to 20 people in 2021, was cut back to 11. Standards tightened and an explicit filter was added to new investments: the founder must align with Paradigm's mission to advance the frontier of crypto.`,
    `The website episode proved instructive in another way. The swift negative reaction showed how much the crypto community had come to view Paradigm as more than just another investment company. It was a standard bearer for the industry.`
