    `With his roommates, Huang applied to Y Combinator in his final year of MIT, initially facing rejection. Graham told them: "We love you guys. We couldn't hate your idea more." Six months later, with a working prototype, they got in. The MIT graduates drove cross-country to San Francisco in six days. At YC, they built what Huang now calls "a terrible idea"—a TV guide website for the streaming era called Hotspots. This "failed startup" chapter that lasted two years nonetheless gave him deep empathy for founders and led to an acquisition by Twitter, where he observed a "terribly run" company during its pre-IPO period.`,
    `By 2012, Huang was ready to carve a new path. In his mind, Silicon Valley had become too obvious; the consumer space too predictable for interesting work and compelling returns. During a week-long vacation from Twitter, with thoughts of founding a tech company in China, he visited Beijing to meet six founders. One was Zhang Yiming, who was building what seemed like another doomed consumer app. Yiming spoke through a translator, but Huang found himself captivated by the founder's nonverbal cues—his gestures, expressions, and intensity painting a picture he didn't need words to understand. Huang left the apartment thinking, "I've got to figure out some way to back this person."`,
    `He wrote a check into ByteDance at $20 million and $30 million valuations, marking his largest personal investment at the time. With ByteDance now worth $300 billion, his investment has multiplied roughly 10,000x—turning an illustrative $50,000 into $500 million. He still holds most of his position, and while he's "increasingly zen about it," he admits "it definitely messes with your head that it's probably the best investment I'll ever make." That same year, in San Francisco, he made seed investments in YC companies Instacart, Benchling, PlanGrid, and Amplitude—all now billion-dollar companies.`,
    `In 2014, when a Sequoia recruiter's email appeared in his inbox while at Twitter, Huang initially dismissed it as spam. Despite his impressive track record, he had no intention of becoming an investor. But curiosity prevailed, and his interview assignment—a one-pager on a company Sequoia should invest in—led him to write about Coinbase, then just seven employees.`

    `At Sequoia, Huang found what he calls "the highest-standards place I've ever experienced." When Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion on his second day, partners gathered briefly in the lobby. Champagne was poured but left untouched. Within five minutes, everyone had returned to work. Eleven-figure exits faded into the shadows of the firm's legendary portfolio that includes trillion-dollar businesses like Apple, Google, and Nvidia. The culture demanded excellence in ways that elevated his already considerable ambition.`,
    `"You start to see how far the axes extend, what a great founder looks like," Huang says of his four years there. "Without being exposed to that, your whole perception of what's possible is missing the dynamic range of the top end." Sequoia also showed him that excellence takes many forms. Working alongside investors with widely different styles but consistency in key dimensions gave him confidence to develop his own approach: "The realization that I can do it my own way was very liberating."`,
    `Sequoia, for its part, got something valuable in return. "Sequoia US was getting its ass kicked by Sequoia China in their poker tournament every year," Leone remembers. "And he went and he won it for Sequoia US. We brought back the Don Valentine crazy-colored jacket thanks to Matt Huang." You won't hear this story from Huang, who never boasts about his achievements. Like many things about him, you have to learn it from others, or know exactly what to ask.`
